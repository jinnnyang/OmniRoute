# CLAUDE.md

@AGENTS.md

**All project rules live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)** — the single source of truth for every AI
assistant (architecture, conventions, testing, quality gates, git workflow, the 23 Hard Rules,
PII learnings). Read it in full; do not re-add project rules here. Everything below applies ONLY
to Claude Code — operational refinements of rules already defined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Worktree isolation — Claude Code specifics

The full mandatory worktree protocol (base-branch confirmation, `.claude/worktrees/` canonical
path, `cp -al` node_modules, teardown rules) is in `AGENTS.md` → Git Workflow → "Worktree
isolation". Claude-Code-specific points:

- Confirm the base branch with the operator via `AskUserQuestion` (Hard Rule #19) unless they
  already told you.
- Prefer the native `EnterWorktree` tool — it already creates worktrees under
  `.claude/worktrees/` (the canonical path). Create the worktree with the documented `git
worktree add` command, then call `EnterWorktree` with its `path`.

## Cross-session safety — Claude Code specifics

Hard Rules #19/#21/#22 (in `AGENTS.md`) govern parallel sessions. Operational reminders for this
harness:

- **Replicate the `git stash` ban verbatim in the prompt of every subagent that touches git**
  (Agent tool / Workflow scripts) — subagents do not inherit this file, and the recorded
  recurrence of the stash incident came through a subagent.
- Before merging or pushing to any PR you did not create _this session_, run `git worktree list`
  and re-check `gh pr view <N> --json state,headRefOid` (Hard Rule #22b).
- End every session with the main checkout on the branch it started on.

## Superpowers / planning artifacts — path overrides

The `_tasks/` convention is defined in `AGENTS.md` → "Planning & Research Artifacts". The
superpowers skills ship with defaults that point at `docs/…` — those defaults are **overridden
here**. When a superpowers skill announces a path like "saved to `docs/superpowers/plans/…`",
rewrite it to the `_tasks/…` equivalent before writing:

| Artifact (skill)                   | Default (do NOT use)      | Save here instead                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plans (`writing-plans`)            | `docs/superpowers/plans/` | `_tasks/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`            |
| Specs / design (`brainstorming`)   | `docs/superpowers/specs/` | `_tasks/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`       |
| Research (`deep-research`, ad-hoc) | `docs/research/`          | `_tasks/research/…`                                           |
| Hand-offs (`/handoff`)             | —                         | `_tasks/hands-off/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<branch>_v<versão>_sess-<id>/` |

Commit those artifacts inside the `_tasks/` repo (`git -C _tasks …`), never in the main repo.

## Scratch / temporary files — use `_artifacts/`, not `/tmp`

This project overrides the harness's default session scratchpad (`/tmp/claude-*/…`). Write
temporary/working files — exports, generated zips, one-off intermediate outputs, anything you'd
otherwise put in `/tmp` — to `/home/diegosouzapw/dev/proxys/OmniRoute/_artifacts/` instead.

- `_artifacts/` is a root `_*` path: already gitignored (`AGENTS.md` → "Root `_*` paths"), lives
  on disk only, never tracked.
- Reason: keeping scratch output inside the project (vs `/tmp`) makes it trivial for the operator
  to find and delete everything temporary in one place, instead of hunting across ephemeral
  session-specific `/tmp` directories that vanish or accumulate untracked.
- Do **not** confuse this with `_tasks/` (Hard Rule #23, its own private git repo for durable
  plans/specs/research/hand-offs) — `_artifacts/` is for disposable working files only, nothing
  here needs to survive or be versioned.

## Base-green before opening PRs

Before cutting a branch or opening a PR, run the base-green check (`AGENTS.md` → Git Workflow →
"Base-green check"; project skills reference it as `.agents/skills/_shared/base-green.md`). A PR
opened while the base tip is red must carry `⚠️ base-red inherited: #<issue>` in its body. To
drain an accumulated red state (base tip + red PRs), use the `/sweep-reds` skill.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **OmniRoute** (126776 symbols, 251119 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "release/v3.8.50"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
